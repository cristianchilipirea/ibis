WARNING: For convienience the autorization.php script exists, but it just returns true. DO NOT USE IT!
Ideally you would implement your own authorization system.
In our case, authorization is done using a script imported from https://github.com/cristianchilipirea/aa and authentication si done using a dokuwiki and ldap server.
